					<p style = "font-size: 20px; margin-top: 80px">What do I need to do?</p>
					<p>First of all, you're going to need your survey topic and general questions/answers 
					related to it decided. What is special about being a <i>simple survey</i> is that each survey
					will be limited to a maximum of <b>10</b> questions, and each question will have anything from
					<b>2 to 5</b> multiple choice answers. No typing or written answers allowed!</p>
					<p style = "font-size: 20px">Why not?</p>
					<p>The main reason of having these special rules for <i>simple surveys</i> is to let the user
					who is completing the survey for you know that it will be a very fast survey. No "it will take
					only 15 minutes of your time" stuff here! Each simple survey should be able to be completed by
					a maximum of 5 minutes, for those who really want to read and answer each question properly. Other's
					will be easily finished in a matter of seconds. What we want to achieve with our <i>simple surveys</i>
					is the guarantee that the survey will be a fast one!</p>
					<p style = "font-size: 20px">So what are you waiting for? Start here!</p>
					<p style = "font-size: 12px">All you need to do to get started is tell us how many questions you want in your survey:</p>
